Alfresco Share is a team- and project-based collaboration client that sits on top of the Alfresco repository. The goal of this project is to provide a microblogging component that can run within Alfresco Share and any other web application built with Alfresco Surf.

This component installs easily as an Alfresco AMP for the repository tier and a ZIP for the Share/Surf tier. See the [introduction](Introduction.md) for more details.

The original [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com) dev team that put this together was:
  * Jeff Potts
  * Michael Ruflin
  * Matthias Geisler
  * Xavier Naud

This was originally developed for 3.2 Community. [Metaversant](http://www.metaversant.com) recently confirmed that this component will work on:
  * 3.3 Enterprise
  * 3.4 Community
  * 3.4 Enterprise

Note that as of 3.4 Community, Alfresco added their own status component to the Share user interface. It's not as cool as this one :) but you may want to take a look before you decide which one to use.
